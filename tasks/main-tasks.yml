# 1. git requires an "email address" for its commits.
# 2. It will "autodetect", but only if hostname can be resolved to an FQDN,
#    or a name has been provided in /etc/mailname.
# 3. etckeeper provides an email address, but only when sudo is used,
#    or when etckeeper is run from a tty.
#
# This leaves us with a couple of cases where etckeeper will fail,
# so we need to make sure to provide user.email in the git config.
